# Privacy Policy
Last Updated: September 2025

This browser extension is built to be private and secure.

## Core Principle: Simple app, just export -> to your computer
The extension does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal information or conversation data. All processing occurs locally in your browser. The extension has no analytics, no tracking, and does not connect to any external servers.

## How It Works
When you click "export" on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok, the extension reads the conversation content from your current tab and saves it directly to your computer as a text file. It only accesses this data when you click "export."

## Required Permissions
The extension needs minimal permissions to function:

### Access AI websites: To read conversation text for exporting.

### Downloads: To save the exported files to your device.

## Compliance
This extension is designed to comply with Chrome Web Store policies and major privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
