# LLM Conversation Exporter

## Short Description
Export conversations from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok to plain text files.

## Detailed Description
A simple, private, open-source extension to export your conversations from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok to a `.txt` file. All processing happens locally in your browser. We collect no data, have no analytics, and connect to no servers.

## Limitations
The attachments (like copied pasted long bits of text) in Claude won't be extracted.  
Definitely google search other extensions like this one to handle Claude!  
It's more likely to break than just grabbing the messages and would require more time to maintain -- but definitely doable 🙏🙏

## How It Works
Open a conversation, click the extension icon, then click **Export**.  
Simple tool, simple purpose: Just export → to your computer.
